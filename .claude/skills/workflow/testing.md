# Workflow — Testing

## Stack

- **Runner:** Vitest
- **DOM:** jsdom
- **Components:** React Testing Library + `@testing-library/user-event`
- **Coverage:** `@vitest/coverage-v8`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run test            # Run all tests once
pnpm run test:watch      # Watch mode
pnpm run test:coverage   # With V8 coverage report
open coverage/index.html # Open HTML coverage report
```

## Test Directory

`tests/` at project root — outside `src/` so Next.js compilation doesn't process test files.

```
tests/
├── setup.tsx          # Global mocks — run before every suite
├── test-utils.tsx     # Custom render wrapping Redux Provider
├── components/        # Component tests
├── data/              # Data integrity tests
├── lib/               # Utility function tests
├── store/             # Redux slice tests
└── ui/                # UI logic tests (variants, timeline utils)
```

## Global Mocks (setup.tsx)

Applied globally — do **not** re-mock in individual test files. Document your project's global mocks here:

- Browser APIs: `matchMedia`, `IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`
- Next.js: `next/link`, `next/image`, `next/navigation`
- i18n: locale navigation helpers (if using next-intl or similar)
- Animation libraries: `framer-motion`, `gsap` / `ScrollTrigger`, `@react-three/fiber`, etc.
- Theme: theme provider (if using `next-themes` or similar)

## test-utils.tsx

Use instead of the default `render` for any component that uses the Redux store:

```tsx
import { render } from '../test-utils'
// wraps in <Provider store={store}>
```

## What to Test

- **Utilities** (`src/lib/utils/`) — pure functions, edge cases
- **State slices** — initial state, action creators, state transitions
- **Components** — rendered text, conditional classes, user interactions, open/closed state
- **Data integrity** — required fields, unique IDs, sequential ordering
- **i18n completeness** — all locale namespaces have all keys present in the baseline locale (if applicable)

## What NOT to Test

- Purely presentational Server Components (no logic)
- Static data shape — TypeScript strict mode covers this
- Animations and visual details

## Rules

- Prefer `getByRole()` / `getByText()` over `querySelector`
- One assertion per `it()`
- Never mock internal utilities — mock only at system boundaries (fetch, localStorage, router)
- Fix the real issue — do not delete or skip failing tests
- Do not widen types to silence errors
