# Workflow — Feature Planning

## Plan File Location

`.claude/plans/[plan-name]/prd.md`

One folder per feature. The folder name is kebab-case (e.g. `contact-form-redesign`, `services-section`).

## Planning Rules

1. **Read before write** — explore all affected files before proposing any changes
2. **Reuse over create** — check if an existing component, hook, or utility can be extended
3. **Minimal footprint** — touch only what's needed; no cleanup of unrelated code
4. **No speculative features** — plan only what was asked, nothing extra
5. **Explicit Server vs Client decision** — state the reason, not just the answer

## Task Status Convention

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `- [⬜]` | Pending — not started |
| `- [🔄]` | Running — in progress |
| `- [✅]` | Done — complete |

Subtasks are indented two spaces under their parent. Claude adds subtasks inline when a step needs breakdown:

```markdown
- [🔄] Step 1: Build the component
  - [✅] Create index.tsx
  - [🔄] Add props type
  - [⬜] Wire translations
- [⬜] Step 2: Add data file
```

**PRD history is sacred:** When updating a PRD (e.g. after a re-audit), always preserve completed tasks (`[✅]`). Add new steps in a new "Round N" section — never overwrite done steps.

## Plan File Format

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Context
What this feature does and why it's needed.

## Component Type Decision
- Server or Client? — [answer + reason]
- Placement: `src/components/layout/[Section]/` or `src/components/ui/[name]/`

## Affected Files
- `src/path/to/file.tsx` — what changes and why

## New Files
- `src/path/to/new-file.tsx` — what it contains

## Data & Types
- New types: `src/types/[name].ts`
- New data: `src/data/content/[name].ts` or `src/data/config/[name].ts`

## Design System
- Colors: exact tokens (e.g. `text-primary dark:text-success`)
- Typography: font classes + where used
- Spacing: container/section patterns
- Animations: library + duration

## i18n (if applicable)
- Translation keys needed
- RTL considerations (if any)

## Implementation Steps
- [⬜] Step 1: ...
- [⬜] Step 2: ...
- [⬜] Step 3: ...

## Verification
- [⬜] `pnpm run dev` → navigate to ...
- [⬜] Check dark mode
- [⬜] Check mobile at 375px
- [⬜] `pnpm run type:check`
- [⬜] `pnpm run test` (if logic/utilities were added or changed)
```
